DATA DICTIONARY 

-In this ERD, we created two new tables. One table for analysis based on year,
and another for analysis based on genre and title type.

-We had to make two tables instead of one because each title has 3 genres,
which means that each title's rating will count towards 3 different genres.
However, we only want one rating to count for our year analysis. Thus, we
split one table into two tables so that the year analysis is not incorrectly
calculated.

2 NEW TABLES EXPLAINED:---------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------TABLE 1: year facts------------------------------------

-In title_basics, the PK title_id is linked to a new table called year_facts.
-This table will show IMDB analytics for the year that movie was released.
-In year_facts, title_id is both the primary key and foreign key. 

-Amount of appalling titles in a year is given by "yr_Quantity_appalling"
-Amount of average titles in a year is given by "yr_QUantity_average"
-Amount of outstanding movies in a year is given by "yr_Quantity_outstanding"

------------------------TABLE 2: imdb facts-------------------------------------

-In imdb_facts, both title_id and genre are needed to uniquely identify 
the data.
-the PK of title_basics title_id is linked to title_id in imdb_facts. 
Similarly, The PK genre from title_genre is linked to genre in 
imdb_facts
-Because each title receives 3 genres, our analytics for genre will 
have 3x more data. This is fine, but we just have to keep this in mind.
-Because each title receives 3 genres, each title_type will also get 
3x more data. In order to correct this, we have to divide by 3 when doing
the analysis on SQL.

-Amount of appalling titles based on genre/type is given by "Quantity_appalling"
-Amount of average titles based on genre/type is given by "Quantity_average"
-Amount of outstanding titles based on genre/type is given by "Quantity_outstanding"
